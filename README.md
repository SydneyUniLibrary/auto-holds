AutoHolds
=========

AutoHolds is a Python Django web application that allows patrons of [Sierra](https://www.iii.com/products/sierra) libraries 
to register interest in authors and automatically have holds placed whenever the library gets a new title by that author.



! Experimental !
----------------

**AutoHolds is not yet ready for production use.** 

It was developed as part of the [IUG 2016 Hackathon](https://www.iii.com/community/inn-side-view/iug-2016-hackathon-recap).
We are continuing to actively develop and test it at [Geauga County Public Library](https://geaugalibrary.net/).
