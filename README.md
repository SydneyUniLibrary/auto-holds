AutoHolds
=========

AutoHolds is a Python Django web application that allows patrons of [Sierra](https://www.iii.com/products/sierra) libraries 
to register interest in authors and automatically have holds placed whenever the library gets a new title by that author.



! Not being maintained !
------------------------

**AutoHolds never reached production use and is not being maintained.** 

It was developed as part of the [IUG 2016 Hackathon](https://www.iii.com/community/inn-side-view/iug-2016-hackathon-recap).
There are no plans to further develop this. It is here for preservation purposes.

Please feel free to fork and develop it in any direction you wish.
